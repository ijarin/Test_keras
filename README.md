# Test_keras  <br />
This is just a simple test code to train a Neural Network (ALEXNET) model with Cifar10 or Cifar100 dataset <br />
Change config.yaml file dataset to Cifar10/Cifar100 according to your dataset choice  <br />
change config.yaml batch size/learning rate (lr) to any of your preferable values <br />
Run train.py (command: python train.py) to train the NN model
